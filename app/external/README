VictoryCMS - Content managment system and framework.

Copyright (C) 2010-2011	Lewis Gunsch <lgunsch@victorycms.org>

The directory containing this file is where you can store external libraries specific to your web application.
For global libraries refer to /lib/external/. In order for VictoryCMS to load your external library, you must
edit the main config.json file. In the config file, add your library to the array of libraries under the 
variable 'app-external'. Here is an example:

"app-external":	[  
					{
						"name": "MyLibrary",
						"class": "\\Namespace\\Sub-namespace\\class"
					},
					{
						"name": "MyLibrary2",
						"class": "MyClassWithNoNamespace"
					}
				]
				
The class of your library that you specify in this config file is the one to be instantiated by VictoryCMS. In order
for it to be properly instantiated, it should extend /lib/Vcms-AbstractLibraryInit.php.
